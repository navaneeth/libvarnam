# Introduction

`libvarnam` is a cross platform, self learning, open source library which support transliteration and reverse transliteration for Indian languages. At the core is a C shared library providing algorithms and patterns for transliteration. `libvarnam` has a simple learning module built-in which can learn words to improve the transliteration experience.

## Installation

`libvarnam` uses `CMake` as build system. `libvarnam` doesn't have any external dependencies. So building it is easy.

```shell
$ cmake .
$ make
$ make install
```

# Getting started

You can use `varnamc` which is a command line client to `libvarnam` to quickly try out `libvarnam`. 

```shell
$ ./varnamc
varnamc : no actions specified
Usage: varnamc options args
    -l, --library FILE               Sets the varnam library
    -v, --verbose                    Enable verbose output
    -t, --transliterate TEXT         Transliterate the given text
        --indic-digits               Turns on indic digit rendering while transliterating
    -r, --reverse-transliterate TEXT Reverse transliterate the given text
    -n, --learn [TEXT]               Learn the given text
    -a, --train PATTERN=WORD         Train varnam to use PATTERN for WORD
    -f, --learn-from FILE|DIRECTORY  Reads from the specified file/directory
        --train-from FILE|DIRECTORY  Reads the specified file/directory and trains all the words specified
    -e, --export-words               Export words to the output directory
    -s, --symbols VALUE              Sets the symbols file
    -c, --compile FILE               Compile symbols file
        --learnings-file FILE        Specify the file to store all learnings
        --detect-language WORD       Detect language of the word
    -d, --output-dir dir             Sets the output directory
    -h, --help                       Display this screen
        --version                    Display version
```

Each supported language will have a scheme file under the `schemes` directory. This scheme file is in plain text format and needs to be compiled before using. To compile a scheme file, use the following command. 

```shell
$ ./varnamc --compile schemes/<SCHEME_FILE_NAME>
```

This will generate a file named <SCHEME_FILE_NAME>.vst (*V*arnam *S*ymbol *T*able) which is a binary file which contains all symbols defined in the scheme file. Running `make install` will install VST files and this allows `varnamc` to be used outside the source directory. 

You can now start using `libvarnam`. To transliterate a word.

```shell
$ ./varnamc --symbols ml --transliterate navaneeth
```

Above command uses Malayalam symbols and transliterate the text 'navaneeth'.

Similarly if you want varnam to learn some word

```shell
$ ./varnamc --symbols ml --learn വർണം
```

# Public API

`api.h` defines the public API for `libvarnam`. Take a look at api.h in the source for available functions.

In short, `libvarnam` can be initialized using `varnam_init()`. `varnam_init()` will initialize a handle which needs to be passed to all other functions. `varnam_transliterate()` can transliterate a word. `varnam_learn()` can be used to learn a word. 

Following example shows a simple usage of `libvarnam`.

```c
#include <varnam.h>

int main(int args, char **argv)
{
  int rc, i;
  char *error;
  varnam *handle;
  varray *result;
  vword *word;

  rc = varnam_init("path/to/ml-unicode.vst", &handle, &error);
  if (rc != VARNAM_SUCCESS)
  {
     printf ("Initialization failed. %s\n", error);
     return 1;
  }

  rc = varnam_transliterate (handle, "navaneeth", &result);
  if (rc != VARNAM_SUCCESS)
  {
     printf ("Transliteration failed. %s\n", varnam_get_last_error(handle));
     return 1;
  }

  for (i = 0; i < varray_length (result); i++)
  {
     word = varray_get (result, i);
     printf ("%s\n", word->text);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

On a GNU/Linux machine, above example can be compiled using the following command:

```shell
gcc `pkg-config --cflags --libs varnam` -o example example.c
```

# Supported languages

* Hindi
* Malayalam
* Gujarati (Experimental)

# Adding a new language

A new language can be added to `libvarnam` by adding a new scheme file. A scheme file is a simple Ruby file which can be used to specify the symbols for a language. The best way to write a new scheme file is to refer to an existing one. All the scheme files are stored under `schemes/` directory.

## Metadata

A scheme file often starts with metadata.

<table>
<tr><td>language_code</td><td>Language code for the scheme</td></tr>
<tr><td>identifier</td><td>A unique identifier to identify this scheme</td></tr>
<tr><td>display_name</td><td>Friendly name for this scheme</td></tr>
<tr><td>author</td><td>Author of the scheme file</td></tr>
</table>

## Syntax

```ruby
<symbol-type> options, symbols
```

`options` and `symbols` should be valid Ruby hashes. `options` is optional argument and can contain the following values.

```ruby
options = {:accept_if => starts_with | ends_with | in_between, :priority => 0..9}
```

`symbols` should be a hash with patterns as keys and replacement as values. It can have the following form.

```ruby
'a' => 'a-value', 'b' => 'b-value'
['a', 'aa'] => 'b-value'
```

Given the above mapping, varnam will replace token `a` with `a-value` and token `b` with `b-value`. Multiple patterns can be specified in an array. In this case, both `a` and `aa` will resolve to `b-value`.

## Symbol types

The following functions are available in the scheme files to define different types of symbols. 

* vowels
* consonants - Usually specified with the inherent 'a' sound.
* consonant_vowel_combinations
* anusvara
* visarga
* virama
* symbols
* numbers
* others

## Other functions

Following functions are available in a scheme file.

### infer_dead_consonants

Usage

```ruby
infer_dead_consonants true
```

When this option is set, varnam will infer dead consonant from a consonant definition. Consider the following statements. 

```ruby
infer_dead_consonants true

consonants 'ka' => 'क'
```

In this case, varnam will create a consonant `ka` which will resolve to `क` and a dead consonant `k` which resolves to `क्`.

### generate_cv

When this function is called, varnam will autogenerate consonant-vowel combinations. Consider the following statements.

```ruby
vowels 'aa' => ['आ', 'ा']

consonants 'ka' => 'क'

generate_cv
```
In this case, varnam will generate consonant-vowel combinations like, `kaa` => 'का'

### list

Creates a custom list and adds the tokens into the list.

```ruby
list :consonants_with_inherent_a_sound do
   consonants 'ka' => 'क'
end

# Token 'ka' will be added to the custom list named 'consonants_with_inherent_a_sound'. To read it,
consonants_with_inherent_a_sound.each do |c|
  puts c
end
```

### combine

`combine` function can be used to generate combination of tokens. Consider the following scheme file for *Hindi*.

```ruby
consonants "k" => "क",
           ["kh", ["gh"]] => "ख",
           ["gh", ["kh"]] => "घ",

# Generating ka, kha etc
consonants(combine get_consonants, ["*a"] => ["*1"])
```

It takes a list as the first argument and hash as the second argument. List could be any custom defined lists created using the `list` function or it could be any built-in list. In the above example, `combine` will iterate over the list `get_consonants` and replace the wildcard character `*` with current pattern and `*1` with value1. For values, you can use `*1`, `*2` and `*3` for getting `value1`, `value2` and `value3`.

`combine` function returns a hash that can be passed to token creation functions like `consonants` or `vowels`.

### Setting priority for a token

When defining a token, you can assign some priority to it. When varnam does the tokenization, high priority tokens will appear first in the list.

```ruby
consonants({:priority => :high}, 'ka' => 'क')
```

This will generate consonant `ka` with priority set to `high`.

### Setting accept condition for a token

Each token can have an optional accept condition. Accept condition can have 1 of 3 possible values. `starts_with`, `ends_with` and `in_between`. 

```ruby
consonants({:accept_if => :starts_with}, 'ka' => 'क')
```

In this case, varnam will accept token `ka` only if the pattern starts with `ka`.
